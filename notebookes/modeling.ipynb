    "# Intelligent Loan Approval Prediction System ML Models\n",
    "The system is designed to predict the likelihood of loan approval by analyzing historical data containing applicantsâ€™ financial and personal attributes. By employing advanced ML algorithms, the model can capture complex patterns and relationships between features, enabling more informed and objective predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, multiple machine learning models are explored and compared to identify the most effective approach for predicting loan approvals. The selected models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- XGBoost\n",
    "- LightGBM\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "- Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "By training and evaluating these models on historical loan datasets, the system aims to provide a reliable, data-driven mechanism for loan approval prediction. This approach not only helps financial institutions minimize default risk but also ensures a fair and consistent evaluation process for applicants."
